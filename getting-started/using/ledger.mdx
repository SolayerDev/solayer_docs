**More details for Ledger users**

To ensure smooth functionality when interacting with smart contracts, it is essential to enable blind signing on your Ledger device. This is necessary because smart contract transaction details cannot be displayed on the Ledger screen. Consequently, for third-party integrations, you will only be able to sign transactions if blind signing is enabled. Hereâ€™s a clearer explanation:

#### Instructions for Enabling Blind Signing:

1. **Purpose:** Blind signing allows you to authorize transactions that cannot be fully displayed on the Ledger device, which is often the case with smart contract interactions.
2. **Requirement:** For any third-party application or integration that involves smart contracts, blind signing must be enabled on your Ledger device. Without this, you will not be able to complete the transaction signing process.
3. **Steps to Enable Blind Signing:**
   * Open the Ledger Live application on your computer.
   * Connect your Ledger device and unlock it.
   * Navigate to the settings menu.
   * Enable blind signing in the device settings.

By enabling blind signing, you ensure that you can seamlessly interact with smart contracts and complete necessary transactions, even when detailed transaction data cannot be displayed on the Ledger screen.\
