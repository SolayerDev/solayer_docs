We are not first time builders in crypto. We also did not get into crypto for the hype. We were in this space when no one knew what it was. 

Product Market Fit is not a commonly used metric in crypto products, and very much narrative-driven just like any novel technological darling. 

Yes, absolutely, we need to capture the narrative, but there were few strategic decisions we made to ensure the product outlasts narrative. 

PoS staking has unchallenged PMF, so in addition to restaking, our 1st layer infrastructure covers everything Marinade or JITO has built — single stake pool and MEV-boost yield. Unlike Eigenlayer, which does not have liquid staking, it does not generate revenue. Solana only has 4B USD in SOL staked, and the opportunity is a 80B USD market. 

We did not fundamentally agree with Eigenlayer’s technical architecture. So we re-architected, in a sense, restandardized restaking in the Solana land. Reusing stake as a way of securing network bandwidth for apps. We aim to become the de facto infrastructure for stake-weighted quality of service, and eventually, a core primitive of the Solana blockchain/consensus.
