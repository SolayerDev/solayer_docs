description: 'Solayer is the dominant restaking marketplace on Solana..'
---


Solayer is an advanced restaking protocol built natively on Solana, designed to empower on-chain decentralized applications (dApps) with improved network bandwidth while simultaneously enhancing L1 security.

Our primary goal is to provide Solana dApps with increased capabilities for securing block space and prioritizing transaction inclusion.


## Core Components

Solayer's architecture comprises two main approaches:

### Restaking Architecture
The restaking component of Solayer includes:

- Restaking Pool Manager: Oversees asset flow and conversion into Solayer-specific tokens (e.g., sSOL).
- Delegation Manager: Handles stake distribution across validators and AVSs.
- Stake Pool: Manages validator selection and MEV-boosted returns.

## Shared Validator Network
- The SVN facilitates: Cross-chain Interoperability: Allows Solana-based chains to share security.
- Optimized Resource Allocation: Efficiently distributes network resources based on stake.

### Technical Integration
For developers and integration partners, Solayer offers:

- CLI: A command-line interface for interacting with Solayer (endoAVS and restaking)
- API Documentation: Comprehensive guides for interacting with Solayer contracts.
- Smart Contract Interfaces: Well-defined interfaces for building compatible dApps.


## Usage

To get started with Solayer, you can either use Ledger or Phantom wallet. You can find more detailed instructions below.
