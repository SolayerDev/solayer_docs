Security is a core development effort of Solayer's long-hauled commitment to building secure and scalable crypto-economic infrastructure. Here we present our audit reports:

1. [OtterSec](https://github.com/solayer-labs/token-metadata/blob/07981c9059f64b50132a67c9db57219ed194678d/audit.pdf): April, 2024 Audit

3. [Halborn - endoAVS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solayer-labs/solayer-improvement-proposal/main/audits/endoavs/Halborn-audit-report-endoavs-program.pdf): August, 2024
4. [Halborn - restaking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solayer-labs/solayer-improvement-proposal/main/audits/restaking/Halborn-audit-report-restaking-program.pdf): August, 2024

Despite having thorough security reviews, we encourage community members, technical hackers, and researchers to comprehensively review the contracts, and report to `report@solayer.org`, or via proper channels if any bugs have been identified.

Lastly, Solayer will conduct two audits per year on all existing contracts.
