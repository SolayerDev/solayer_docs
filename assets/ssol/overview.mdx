For native SOL deposits, Solayer first converts your SOL to an intermediary form called sSOL-raw, which is the token issued by the stake pool manager. This entire process is non-custodial, ensuring that SOL is delegated to validators who earn MEV-boosted returns. The sSOL-raw is then converted to sSOL after another interaction with the Solayer pool manager. All these steps are executed in a single transaction for efficiency.

### Solayer Native SOL Withdrawal Functions

Tokens can only be withdrawn from a stake account when they are not delegated. When you first un-delegate a stake account, it enters a "cooldown" phase. Tokens cannot be withdrawn until this process is complete and they are "inactive," meaning they no longer earn rewards. Once tokens in a stake account are inactive, they can be immediately withdrawn to your main wallet address. For details on the duration of this transition, please refer to [**Timing Considerations**](https://solana.com/staking#overview/delegation-timing-considerations).

### Withdraw

Withdrawing LSTs is simple. Select the amount you wish to withdraw, and the tokens will be sent back to your main wallet address.

* Upon withdrawing, you will be able to see the full amount of rewards, as well as the deductions from your account;
* It is important to note that we are not deducting anything from your deposit but take a percentage of the accrued credits so far.

### Accounting Deduction

Our accounting system works as follows:

* The base calculation for rewards = deposit \* time-weight \* boost

Currently, native SOL has a significant priority over other LSTs. However, we may begin campaigns to boost other LST deposits.

## Examples

_**Withdrawing All Tokens from a Stake Account**_

1. User has a wallet with a balance of 900 SOL and a single stake account with 100 SOL delegated to a validator.
2. The user uses the wallet interface to deactivate their stake delegation. The stake account shows in the wallet interface and on the Explorer that it is “Deactivating.” Once it is “Inactive,” the tokens stop earning rewards and can be withdrawn;
3. The wallet interface can be used to withdraw all tokens back into the main wallet account. The wallet balance now shows 1,000 SOL and the stake account is closed.

_**Reducing the Delegation Staked to a Given Validator**_

1. User has a wallet with a balance of 800 SOL and a single stake account with 200 SOL delegated to a validator.
2. User wants to reduce the amount of stake delegated to the validator by 100 SOL.
3. Use the wallet interface to “Split” the stake account and specify 100 SOL as the amount to split.
4. There are now 2 stake accounts, each with 100 SOL, delegated to the same validator.
5. The user can then use the wallet interface to deactivate one of their stake delegations. The stake account shows in the wallet interface and on the Explorer that it is “Deactivating.” Once it is “Inactive,” the staked tokens stop earning rewards and can be withdrawn;
6. Once the account is inactive, the user can then choose to delegate the account to a different validator, withdraw the tokens back into the main wallet, or further split the inactive stake account and delegate to multiple different validators.

**Note:** Tokens in a stake account with a lockup may not be withdrawn until the lockup expires, regardless of the delegation state of that account. Once the lockup expires, undelegated tokens may be withdrawn immediately. There is no action required by the account holder to specifically unlock the account.


## Pool Manager

The pool manager is the core component overseeing asset flow into the protocol. Its key functions include:

- Processing user deposits of LST or SOL
- Converting SOL to sSOL-raw
- Issuing fungible token representations (Solayer assets)

Currently, these Solayer assets are illiquid to facilitate points calculation for the liquidity reward program. Future iterations will introduce liquidity to enhance DeFi composability.

title: What is sSOL?
---

sSOL is the universal liquidity layer for delegates [dApps] and LRTs on Solayer. Every unit of SOL can be perceived as a unit of blockspace lent towards dApps, securing network bandwidth and TPS.

The delegation towards dApps, which derives an AVS SPL token, is built on top of sSOL-SOL liquidity. Similarly, LRTs are built on top of sSOL liquidity interface to generate vault strategies.

There are various ways of utilizing sSOL and earning maximum yield as an sSOL holder:

1. Delegate to dApps to bootstrap network bandwidth
2. Participate in DeFi strategies to earn additional APY, starting with our launch partners

By leveraging sSOL, users can maximize their yield while contributing to the Solayer ecosystem's growth and stability.

There are various ways of utilizing sSOL and earning maximum yield as an sSOL Holder. You can delegate to dApps to bootstrap network bandwidth or participate in DeFi strategies to earn additional APY, starting with our launch partners.

Now we will go through a couple of examples on how you can put your sSOL to work in AMMs, lending protocols, perpetual exchanges, and more.

### Liquidity Vaults on Kamino

Kamino's liquidity vaults are an automated liquidity solution that allows users to earn yield on their crypto assets by providing liquidity to concentrated liquidity market makers (CLMMs).

A vault deploys liquidity into an underlying DEX pool, consisting of 2 tokens. When you deposit into a vault, you earn fees from trading volume.

In other words, if you deposit into a pool with sSOL and SOL, any token swaps that utilize that pool will incur a small cost to the swapper. As a Kamino depositor, you earn from that swap fee.

**Vault Capital Deposit Example**

**Situation**: You have 100 sSOL worth $10,000 USD. You want to earn yield on your assets without active management.

**Use Case**: Deposit your sSOL into a Kamino vault. Your sSOL will provide liquidity to a DEX, earning fees from trading volume. Kamino automates rebalancing and compounding, maximizing your yield.

**Benefit**: Earn yield passively while maintaining exposure to sSOL.

### Liquidity Provision on Orca

Orca utilizes a Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker (CLMM) to enhance capital efficiency and yield for liquidity providers. By providing liquidity to Orca's pools, users can earn yield on their crypto assets through trading fees.

When you provide liquidity to an Orca pool, such as the sSOL-SOL pair, you earn fees from each token swap within that pool. This means if you deposit sSOL and SOL into the pool, any trades that occur between these tokens will generate fees, which are distributed to you as a liquidity provider. Orca automates this process, ensuring optimal capital efficiency and low slippage.

**LP Example**

**Situation**: You have 100 sSOL worth $10,000 USD. You want to earn yield on your assets without active management.

**Use Case**: Deposit your sSOL and an equivalent amount of SOL into an Orca CLMM pool. Your sSOL and SOL will provide liquidity to the DEX, earning fees from trading volume. Orca's advanced CLMM technology will ensure that your assets are utilized efficiently, maximizing your returns.

**Benefit**: Earn yield passively from trading fees while maintaining exposure to both sSOL and SOL.

| _Liquidity Provisioning_            | You will be able to provide sSOL to a number of vaults in DeFi in order to earn additional yield on top of your holdings.                                                  |
| _Collateral_    | You can use sSOL as a collateral on various money markets and borrow against it. This way you can either unlock more capital or directly leverage your position.           |
| _Borrowed Asset_  | sSOL can also be borrowed from available liquidity pools in an over-collateralized fashion.                                                                                |
| _Trading_       | sSOL is available on Raydium and Orca, so you can easily trade it for other tokens on Solana. Keep in mind that trading sSOL may result in your stopping to earn rewards.  |
