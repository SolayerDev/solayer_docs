Solayer's architecture is designed to provide a robust, flexible, and scalable infrastructure solutions on the Solana blockchain. This document outlines the key components and processes that form the foundation of our protocol, offering insights into how Solayer manages assets, delegates stake, and handles rewards.

## Pool Manager

The pool manager is the core component overseeing asset flow into the protocol. Its key functions include:

- Processing user deposits of LST or SOL
- Converting SOL to sSOL-raw
- Issuing fungible token representations (Solayer assets)

Currently, these Solayer assets are illiquid to facilitate points calculation for the liquidity reward program. Future iterations will introduce liquidity to enhance DeFi composability.
