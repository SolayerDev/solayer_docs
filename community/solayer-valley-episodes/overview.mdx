Welcome to Solayer Valley, an interactive campaign streamed in episodic adventures. The valley offers eligible participants the opportunity to redeem hidden gems for future retroactive claims, tied to major product and feature milestones. Each episode represents an alternate world where we unlock and experience these milestones together. Participation in these episodes is the sole method to receive future retroactive rewards.

This is separate from our Epochs, which are based on deposit caps and TVL milestones. 

For example, Episode 1 was where we launched our restaking platform and opened Epoch 3. Since then, we've had several major releases, and will be recapping them in Episode 2 while we continue to build out the restaking network on Solana.
