In 2024, with more than **$500 million staked**, over **200,000 active users**, and **bluechip AVS partners**, we have become the **leading restaking platform** for enhancing internal Solana applications via **stake-weighted quality of service**.

In 2025, we are doubling down on our thesis, introducing the concept of **hardware offloading of blockchain into programmable hardware chips** that is **infinitely scalable** – presenting the **first 1MM TPS network in the world, InfiniSVM**.

<br/>

## $LAYER - Connecting the Solayer Ecosystem

**Infrastructure on the bottom. Vertical stack on the top.**  
Our team is doing more than just delivering the **most scalable infrastructure** through **InfiniSVM**. We're building a **tightly integrated suite of vertical products** within our own ecosystem. **sSOL, sUSD, and our Emerald Card** are only the beginning, with a number of other products **in the pipeline being tested at the speed of light with InfiniSVM**.

Underpinning all of this is **$LAYER**, which is both the **native token for InfiniSVM** as well as the **governance token for Solayer’s protocol suites**.

<br/>


## Token Distribution

![$LAYER at a glance](images/layer/glance.png)

To ensure **broad decentralization**, **$LAYER** is being distributed through both the **community sale of our Emerald Card** and our **genesis airdrop for early adopters**.

The **max supply** of $LAYER will be **1,000,000,000 tokens**, distributed across three main categories, 
with an **initial circulating supply of 220,000,000 $LAYER (22%)**:

### **Community & Ecosystem** [51.23%]
- **34.23%** is for **continued R&D, developer programs, ecosystem growth**, and other user activities.
- **14%** is for **community events/incentives** (including **12% reserved for the Genesis Drop** to reward early adopters and initial claim activities).
- **3%** is distributed via the **Emerald Card community sale**.

### **Core Contributors** [17.11%]
- Reserved for **core contributors and advisors**.

### **Investors** [16.66%]
- Allocation for **investors**.

### **Foundation** [15%]
- Allocated to the **Solayer Foundation** to support **vertical product expansion** and **network development**.

- **Genesis Drop**: Fully **unvested** at launch.
- **Emerald Card Community Sale**: Fully **unvested** at launch.
- **Community incentives**: **Linearly vested** for **6 months**.
- **Community & Ecosystem**: **Vested every 3 months** over **4 years**.
- **Foundation**: **Vested every 3 months** over **4 years**.
- **Team & Advisors**: **1-year cliff, 3 years linear vesting**.
- **Investors**: **1-year cliff, 2 years linear vesting**.

## Token Design

$LAYER has **utility** across the entire **Solayer ecosystem**.  
At launch, the primary utility is **governance**, with **network-specific utility** becoming available with **InfiniSVM**, and **protocol-level utility** with our incoming **vertical product suites**.

### **Governance [current]**
- **Protocol upgrades**, such as **adding supported assets**.
- **Key ecosystem initiatives**, such as **grants**.

### **Future Use Cases [subject to design change]**
- **Participate in Proof of Stake consensus** for **Decentralized Verification** to **earn block rewards**.
- **Verifiers securing Solayer get rewarded with $LAYER**.
- **$LAYER as the gas token** for **transactions on the Solayer network**.

<br/>


## **$LAYER Genesis Drop**

The second **$LAYER distribution** is for **existing community members** who’ve been with us since launching in 2024.  

Solayer is reserving **12% total** for **community members, integration partners, and liquidity providers**, recognizing those who **bootstrapped the ecosystem** and will continue our journey in 2025.

### **Eligibility**
- **sSOL and sUSD holders**.
- **Users who delegated sSOL to AVS partners**.
- **Users who deposited sSOL or sUSD in partnered DeFi protocols**.
- **Users who deposited whitelisted LSTs on Solayer**.
- **Users who deposited with Solayer through partner and wallet campaigns**.
- **LRT protocols**.
- **Other claim initiatives**.

### **Vesting**
For **early and eligible community members**, the **genesis drop is immediately unlocked** at launch, with additional $LAYER **claimable over the next 6 months by Epoch**.

## **A Grassroots Movement for Hardware-Acceleration**

With **over 250,000 unique holders** eligible at launch, we’re forging a path for **hardware acceleration in blockchain**.  

Whether it’s **powering InfiniSVM** or **governing protocol-level products**, **$LAYER** is an **economic alignment force**.  

As we move into the next phase of building an **infinitely scalable, hardware-accelerated blockchain**, **$LAYER ties it all together**.
